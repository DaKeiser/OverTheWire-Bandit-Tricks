This one is related to public-key encryption. Hard to explain exactly what is going on, but know that there are 2 keys for encryption.
Basically, the private key is kept away from everyone else. So the point is that if you had the private key you wouldn't need a 
password to access. And this level gives the password.

What you do is, you get the private key. Then, copy the private key. You can exit the Bandit13 server now. Then change permissions using
chmod to 600. This is important, because if you don't your file will get rejected for being too public (600 only allows Owner User and 
Group). Then use ssh -i to read key from the file and connect, something like ssh -i file_name bandit14....

PS - The "Begin" and "End" aren't comments. Copy that too
