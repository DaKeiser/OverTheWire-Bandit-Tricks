This assumes that you have a Linux system. I think it's a safe assumption since IIITB asks us to download Linux before coming.

Man pages are your friend. Seriously. When you don't know what a command is doing, use man pages. It's pretty simple to access
one, just write "man <command_name>". You'd get an entire page of text. It's in fact usually more useful than those online tutorials
you see out there. Only if you don't understand the man pages do you go there. 
Another reason why man pages are good, for the skeptical of you reading this, is because man pages are offline. So you don't have to 
access the Internet for them.
