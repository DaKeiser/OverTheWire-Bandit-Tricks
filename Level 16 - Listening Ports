Check online for how to find listening ports and you'll find many articles telling you to use 'sudo netstat', 'sudo nmap', etc.
Don't do that, you don't have sudo access, remember!

Instead, use nmap -p <lower_bound>-<upper_bound> <server_host_name>
Then you get a list of ports which have server listening on them. I got back just two ports, one closed and one open. Now use
openssl to connect to both of them and see which one gives you the right answer. My hunch was that the one which was open was likely
to give right answer and it worked.
I got back an SSH private key. Then from level 13 you know what to do from then on
