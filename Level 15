To start off with this level, I advise you to try opening a connection with nc.
You will see that the password doesn't work. Why is that?
The reason is that the password to the next level has been encrypted using SSL encryption.So as our password isn't encrypted it will not 
work.
So what is the solution?
We need to establish a connection to a remote server which speaks SSL/TLS (you'd understand better after a Computer Networks course
but the idea is you'd still understand now).
So for that we write openssl s_client. OpenSSL is your interface for SSL and s_client implements a client which can establish the 
connection.
Write -connect after that. This is like nc, it opens a connection to a host with specified port number. If you don't specify one the 
default is port 4443.
So the command now is openssl s_client -connect localhost::30001.

Well apparently, you should see a Heartbeating error now. This is not something I got so I can't confirm. But the idea is to use
-ign_eof along with your connection. That prevents it on closing the connection the moment it reaches end of file. Again I cam't
verify. But what I can say is that you don't get the required password, because it closes on reaching the eof..

So the command if finally openssl s_client -ign_eof -connect localhost::30001 (don't put -ign_eof after connect!That's like telling it
to connect to -ign_eof)

Note - don't be naive. Pipeline this command with echo as well so that the password is entered without you doing it again.
