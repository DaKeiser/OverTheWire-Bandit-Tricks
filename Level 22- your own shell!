This is a level where I really felt like a hacker :) ! Let's go into why that is the case.

So, look at the shell files they've given in /etc/cron.d. You get bandit22.sh,bandit23.sh, bandit24.sh. Since we're looking for
the password to bandit23, let's look at bandit23. Well if you want to confirm that we have to look at that file, you can cat
the others. bandit22.sh is just what you saw last level, bandit24.sh you aren't allowed to look at.
Anyways explore what's going on in the shell program.We leave this to you because this is important for you to understand.

All I can say is, shell and bash are related. When you execute the script you'll realize that you get the current password of 
the level copied to some file. So try to exploit that and run a command which copies the password of bandit23 to some file,
get which file that is and then access it. This part is fun, so we'll leave it to you!
