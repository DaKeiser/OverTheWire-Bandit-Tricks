So follow the same thing that you did for last level.
You see that the password is xxxxx. So what now?
Well, this is just a general hint. Many of these Bandit levels are just to teach you general tactics and also in this case
about Git itself. No reason for a beginner to think in the following direction. But I'm going off track.
Anyways use git log. 
You see the history of commits. So `now your idea should be to see the differences between each commit. The motto is that
maybe the original password was written but then was changed to xxxxx. This is why I feel these levels are more to teach you
concepts than be actual situations, I'd have just written xxxx without writing the original password first!
Anyways use git log -p. Then you can see what was added in each commit.
So you can see that in one commit there was a password which got changed to xxxx.
There you go
