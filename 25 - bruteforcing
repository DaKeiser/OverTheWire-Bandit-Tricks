So you have a decent idea on how to write at least a very basic shell program. So you can finally feel like that hackerman
you wanted to be when you joined college!
I strongly advise you to not read this and do it yourself. Because it is very much doable without help beyond syntax which 
you can Google.

Still here?
Sigh.

Anyways, this is a level which requires you to write shell again. I mean, sure, you don't really NEED to write shell for this,
but it's your call.
So the question is that you have to connect to a daemon at some given port. You have to connect to it. Then you must enter the 
password of the 24th level and some 4-digit number as a pincode to go along with it. The question doesn't give any information
so the only thing we can do is brute force our way through by writing all of the four digit numbers.I mean sure, you can try
doing it manually, but there are 10,000 of them, and also better things to do in life.

So since I'm assuming you know how to program, your first idea should've been for loop. And for that, you need to write some 
sort of program.
So off we head to your tmp directory again.
Write the shell program. I'm not going to explain this because I want to leave this to you.
But anyways, so what you do is go back to your main directory.
Then execute your .sh file and pipe that execution with connecting to your port. If you do this correctly (you should be able
to, if you aren't then just go and Google piping) then you get... permission denied!

Where did you go wrong?
You forgot to chmod 777 the file! 
So go do that and come back and run it.
Now you've made it open so it should run. And then finally you get the password after many unsuccesful pincodes are passed.
