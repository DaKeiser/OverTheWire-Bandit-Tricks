So here is where you have to be smart. Because you want to take the minimum time possible to solve a question.

Use find -size 1033c directly. as manu
You see that there is only one file which has size 1033 byte size. So you get your answer, and typing time is also minimum.

But you won't always have something this simple. I would advise to first try checking size as many would be non-executable

So now to check non-executable, we write find . ! -executable. This searches for all the non-executable files in the present directory.

As we have seen, xargs file  is like an iterator through all the files in the directory. So we use this in combination with grep command
to find ASCII text.
Well actually you can get the answer from here itself. In order to make it better we use the next 

The next thing we use is awk. A detailed explanation can be found in the manual pages for it.

Awk helps us in scanning line by line and splitting input into different fields.
awk -F means to read from a file instead of the command line. And one advantage of awk is that it lets you access each column. This will be
useful for reasons to be seen below.

Actually the output of the grep command is " blah blah blah file path" + "ASCII text, with very long lines". But we don't want the 
second part. Luckily for us, the ASCII... stuff is in another column. 
So what do we do? We use awk to access the first column only. That gives us the required answer.

So final answer : find . -size 1033c ! -executable|xargs file|grep "ASCII text" |awk -F: '{print $1}'
