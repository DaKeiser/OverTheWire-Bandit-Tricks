One thing that misled me was that I thought setuid was a command. It's not. It's just a flag which allows user to run executables.

So actually this thing isn't so complicated. What I advise you to do is to first go to etc/bandit_pass. Then you'll see passwords of 
every level. Try catting bandit20. It won't work because you don't have required permissions. 
So what do you do then?
Well, use cd without arguments to go back to your ~ directory(I hope you know this by now). Then use ls to see what is given to you.
You get something called bandit20-do in red. So that means it has elevated permissions. If you don't know what that means, read the 
Wikipedia article on setuid.
Now a mistake I made was trying to cat bandit20-do to get some useful information out of it. That's stupid, don't do that.Because it's
an executable (that's the point of setuid). Instead you have to use it. How do you use it? How do run the a.out executable?
Run this the same way.
First just run without passing any arguments. The terminal itself tells you what you can do with it. Now you realize that you can use
this executable to actually do stuff. So that's what you do. You use your executable to open the bandit20
I don't think giving you the command is required or useful. So I'll let you figure it out yourself.
