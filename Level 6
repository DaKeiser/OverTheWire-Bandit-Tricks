(You will find one link telling you a command which dumps the found files into a file. Sounds tempting but don't do it. You aren't allowed
to write files in their systems so permission will be denied. If you didn't find that link when Googling for it forget it. I did)

Use man find to find out how to look for user and group and everything.

Now go all the way to the root from bandit6, that is what "whole server" means. Combine the three requirements over there and note
that only one of the files is accessible to you. Note that it also says bandit7password. Cat that for the answer
