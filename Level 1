Advice - learn to use cat instead of vim or some other text editor. Cat displays the content of the file. Text editors can mess up things at times, 
and moreover you're not always allowed to copy from a vim file, as we saw the hard way.
- is recognized as STDIN bt the cat command. So directly writing cat - won't display file contents, try this out yourself.

What you should do is instead tell cat that you are indeed trying to look at the file. Any file is identified by its file path. So write
an absoulte/relative path for the file when doing cat.
