This one is interesting.
Just use cat data.txt. Then you see that the text has been encrypted with a Caesar cipher. Well, maybe there's a way in Linux but 
we just used an online Caesar cipher. But to make your life easier, notice that the first three words are "THe password is". Why?
Obviously the password doesn't have spaces in it. And we've seen them use these words before. This is in fact how people break codes,
and how the encryption of Enigma was broken (they searched for Heil Hitler). 
It is also confirmation that you're looking at a Caesar cipher. The second word has ff where ss is supoosed to be present in password.
Look at the lengths of the first 3 words too. Run the 4th word through a Caesar cipher cracker and you have your answer.

update : On the shell you can you the command |tr '[a-z]' ['n-za-m'] for rotation of characters by 13.
