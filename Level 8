We have to basically print the unique line. uniq -u returns it. But where people go wrong is that they don't sort it
first. Uniq works based on the sorting (think about why it may be true!)

So you have to sort and then get the unique line and cat it.
To do this, pipeline all. cat data.txt | sort| uniq -u should work
